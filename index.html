          When you hear North Rhine-Westphalia, you think of Cologne Cathedral,
          a major landmark in Germany. And of the ‘cathedrals of industry’ such
          as Zollverein, a colliery turned World Heritage site. Another feature
          of North Rhine-Westphalia: the many universities. No other region has
          such a large concentration of higher education facilities. We live
          with culture, and we are sometimes compared – quite rightly – with big
          international metropolitan centres. Our research establishments are of
          world renown Thinking of North Rhine-Westphalia also means thinking of
          the big rivers. Of the grassland, the forests, the lakes that stretch
          between the Eifel hills and the Teutoburg Forest range. The land along
          the Rhine and Ruhr rivers is built on labour and work. It is also
          ideal for rest and recreation. The history of the Federal Republic of
          Germany would not be complete without North Rhine-Westphalia and the
          city of Bonn. The same goes for the history of Europe. As a state in
          the European heartland, we fully embrace the idea of a united Europe
          of free peoples. Whilst our state has a rich history, it is also well
          positioned for the future. On an international scale, we are amongst
          the strongest economies, thanks to innovating enterprises and a
          broad-based small and medium business sector. Come and discover the
          Diversity State!

            <h3>NRW History</h3>
            <img src="https://www.land.nrw/sites/default/files/styles/video_preview_image_big_960x540/public/assets/images/104_operation_marriage-eroeffnung_landtag_rwb144024.jpg?itok=6G_W3LhV" alt="British meeting to create NRW" class="img-history">
          The British Military Government’s ‘Operation Marriage’ created the
          State of North Rhine-Westphalia on 23 August, 1946, by merging the
          northern part of the former Prussian Rhine Province with Westphalia,
          another province of the now defunct state of Prussia. On 21 January,
          1947, the new state was joined by the territory of Lippe. Karl Arnold,
          a Christian Democrat, became the first democratically elected State
          Premier. The values embraced by the people of North Rhine-Westphalia
          were very neatly summarised when he said, ‘We are Germany’s social
          conscience’. Never again was the Ruhr to become the centre of German
          arms production. At the same time, the Ruhr’s heavy industry was
          needed for rebuilding North Rhine-Westphalia – and Europe. With a view
          to overcoming the political and economic obstacles imposed by the
          International Authority for the Ruhr, the European Coal and Steel
          Community was set up in 1951, driving forward the country’s economic
          recovery and laying the groundwork for European integration. That same
          year, the Coal and Steel Co-determination Act came into force, giving
          shareholders and workers an equal say in how a coal or steel
          corporation is run. The ‘Economic Miracle’ created the basis for
          wealth for all. A major contribution came from the fourteen or so
          million immigrant workers, or ‘guest workers’, many of whom were
          eventually to stay in the country. ‘They called for labourers, and it
          was people who came’, Swiss writer Max Frisch once commented on the
          need for a change of attitude towards the new arrivals. 
          <br>
          <br>
          The Coal Crisis of 1964 brought the first cracks. The problems were addressed –
          albeit only temporarily – through special legislation, referred to as
          ‘Concerted Action’, and the establishment of the Ruhrkohle AG
          corporation. This first coal crisis heralded the onset of painful
          structural changes that were to last several decades. In 1987,
          steelworkers went on strike for the first time in fifty years. Four
          years later, the death knell sounded for the Rheinhausen Rolling Mill
          in Duisburg – which came to symbolise the burgeoning crisis in the
          Ruhr. In 1978, Johannes Rau was elected to succeed Heinz Kühn as
          Premier. During his twenty years at the helm, he was the face and
          voice of North Rhine-Westphalia. The fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989
          consigned socialismmecklenburg-vorpommernW</h3>

            North Rhine-Westphalia has changed in recent decades like no other German region. And like no other region, the state is banking on culture to do its bit to lessen the impact. The results can be viewed across the country, and especially in the Ruhr. Today, the creative industries employ more people than the mining sector. Industrial heritage sites have been turned into workplaces for designers, artists and the advertising industry. Every year, the Ruhrtriennale festival attracts visitors from all over the world.

            <br> 
            <br>
            North Rhine-Westphalia has an unparalleled concentration of museums, cultural centres, concert halls and theatres. Film festivals in Oberhausen, Duisburg, Cologne, Lünen, Münster, Bonn, Dortmund and other places in North Rhine-Westphalia provide quality of the highest standards. Buildings designed by top-notch architects have earned international renown. Artists and performers of the first rank include Pina Bausch, Max Ernst, Emil Schumacher, Joseph Beuys or Bernd and Hilla Becher.

            <br>
            <br>

            Whilst, in terms of culture, North Rhine-Westphalia is right up there with London or Paris, there is a big difference: although we have a long tradition of culture and heritage – in fact, the cathedrals in Aachen and Cologne, the Zollverein colliery and Augustusburg Palace in Brühl are World Heritage Sites - North Rhine-Westphalia was never the land of castles, dynasties and landed gentry. North Rhine-Westphalia was, is and always will be a society dominated by the working and middle classes. We did not inherit our cultural wealth, we worked for it very hard. Culture in North Rhine-Westphalia is therefore the great facilitator of change.

        <img src="https://www.rlp.de/fileadmin/_processed_/5/5/csm_marktplatz_trier_rlp-Tourismus_lap_0694420131.jpg" alt="market square in Rhineland" class="img-rhineland">


        <p class="intro-rhineland">
            Rhineland-Palatinate is a western state of Germany. It covers 19,846 km2 (7,663 sq mi) and has about 4.05 million residents. It is the ninth largest and sixth most populous of the sixteen states. Mainz is the capital and largest city. Other cities are Ludwigshafen am Rhein, Koblenz, Trier, Kaiserslautern and Worms. It is bordered by North Rhine-Westphalia, Saarland, Baden-Württemberg and Hesse and by the countries France, Luxembourg and Belgium.

            Rhineland-Palatinate was established in 1946 after World War II, from parts of the former states of Prussia (part of its Rhineland province), Hesse and Bavaria (its former outlying Palatinate kreis or district), by the French military administration in Allied-occupied Germany. Rhineland-Palatinate became part of the Federal Republic of Germany in 1949 and shared the country's only border with the Saar Protectorate until the latter was returned to German control in 1957. Rhineland-Palatinate's natural and cultural heritage includes the extensive Palatinate winegrowing region, picturesque landscapes, and many castles and palaces.

            <p class="history-rhineland">
                <h3>Rhineland History</h3>

                <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a3/Bundesarchiv_B_145_Bild-F046120-0035%2C_Koblenz%2C_%22Rittersturz-Konferenz%22.jpg/220px-Bundesarchiv_B_145_Bild-F046120-0035%2C_Koblenz%2C_%22Rittersturz-Konferenz%22.jpg" alt="Minister-president Peter Altmeier at the Rittersturz Conference in 1948" class="img-rhineland-history">

            The state of Rhineland-Palatinate was formed after the end of World War II, on 30 August 1946, by the French military government. Traditional structures were not taken into account; instead parts of Germany were merged that had never before belonged together: parts of the Prussian Rhine provinces, the territory of Hessen on the left bank of the Rhine, and the strongly Bavarian-influenced Palatinate. These regions have become closely knit over time, however, and Rhineland-Palatinate has acquired its own identity.
<br>
<br>
            Rhineland-Palatinate has profited greatly from its geographical location. The extensive modernized network of autobahns and federal highways, the convenient rail connections between the cities of Mainz, Kaiserslautern, Trier, Ludwigshafen and Koblenz, the major waterways Rhine and Mosel, as well as the state's proximity to three economically powerful centers - the Rhine-Main, Rhine-Neckar and Rhine-Ruhr regions - have created optimal framework conditions for the development of Rheinland-Pfalz into one of Germany's most dynamic regions.

        <h3>Geography of Rhineland Palatinate</h3>
        <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/89/Coat_of_arms_of_Rhineland-Palatinate.svg/75px-Coat_of_arms_of_Rhineland-Palatinate.svg.png" alt="coat of arms" class="img-geo">

        Rhineland-Palatinate shares international borders with France (Grand Est), Luxembourg (Clervaux, Diekirch, Echternach, Grevenmacher, Remich, and Vianden), and Belgium (Wallonia). Within Germany, it neighbours are Baden-Württemberg, Hesse, Northrhine-Westphalia, and the Saarland. It is the ninth-largest state by area. Rhineland-Palatinate is part of the SaarLorLux euregion.

With 42% of its area covered by forests, it is the most forested state along with Hesse.[9] The state's major rivers are the Rhine, including the UNESCO World Heritage Site Middle Rhine, and the Moselle. Several crater lakes of volcanic origin are in the Eifel, the biggest of which is the Laacher See.

The Rhenish Massif forms roughly the northern half of the state, including the regions Eifel, Moselle Valley, Hunsrück, Westerwald, and parts of the Taunus. The Palatinate forms the biggest part of the southern half along with Rhenish Hesse. The Nahe Valley separates both parts.[10]

                    <br>
                    Schwerin Castle, often referred to as northern Germany's answer to Neuschwanstein Castle, was once the main residence of the Grand Dukes of Mecklenburg-Schwerin. And now the elegant building is the seat of the local government. Just over the road is Schwerin's Old Town, boasting splendid architecture from recent centuries.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    The many castles, palaces and stately homes make stunning backdrops for cultural events during the summer months, including the operas at the Schwerin Castle Theatre Festival, Germany's biggest open-air operettas in the gardens of Neustrelitz Palace, the vibrant Small Festival in a Big Park in Ludwigslust and so many more.

                    <br>
                    The Medieval alleyways in the Hanseatic cities and ports are lined with red-brick buildings, with huge Gothic brick churches towering over them. The best places to admire this style in all its glory are Wismar (UNESCO World Heritage Site), Rostock, Stralsund (UNESCO World Heritage Site) and Greifswald. Gabled houses, massive warehouses and sublime town halls reflect the wealth of the traders and merchants back in the days of the Hanseatic League.

                    <h3>Seaside resorts from the Belle Époque</h3>
                    <br>
                    During the 19th century, the first high-end Baltic Sea resorts emerged alongside the flourishing ports. Grand Duke Friedrich Franz I, who headed to Heiligendamm in 1793 to ease his recovery in the waters of the Baltic Sea, founded the first seaside resort in Germany, marking the birth of the spa culture on the white sandy beaches. Nowadays, there are 29 seaside and spa resorts along the coast. Known for being glamorous and sophisticated, they all feature the typical spa architecture, which the imperial resorts of Ahlbeck, Bansin and Heringsdorf are especially famous for. It's no surprise that the island of Usedom has followed this tradition and now boasts more certified wellness hotels than anywhere else.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <h3>Three national parks and never-ending lakes</h3>
                    <br>
                    In the north of Germany, there is no end of unspoiled natural scenery. For example, the Western Pomerania Lagoon Area National Park is the largest resting site for cranes in the whole of Central Europe. The bright white chalk cliffs at the Jasmund National Park on the island of Rügen can be seen from afar. And they made for a stunning subject in a world-famous painting by Caspar David Friedrich. The Müritz National Park at the heart of the Mecklenburg Lake District is a wooded area that surrounds Müritz, the largest inland lake in Germany. From there, the water landscape extends in all directions, making this a big hit with keen water sports fans. There's the option to ride a canoe on the "Amazon of the North", sail on Lake Müritz or travel from Schwerin to Berlin on a barge holiday. One thing is for sure – this water wonderland is one of a kind! </p>

                ​
                        <p>Barely any other German state has such a wide variety of nature as Lower Saxony, with its protected natural landscapes stretching from   the North Sea to the Harz mountains.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Experience “pure nature” on a tour of discovery on the Wadden Sea and keep an eye out for lynx in the forests of the Harz mountains. While some natural landscapes are home to particular animals, offering a habitat for seals and migrating birds, others are characterised by particular plant life. The heather in the Lüneburger Heide and other geest landscapes provides a magnificent display of colour when in bloom. Cotton grass is characteristic of the many moors of the Emsland and the Diepholzer Moorniederung areas.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        The issue of sustainability plays a role at every level in Lower Saxony. Many information centres provide interesting information and interactive exhibits on maintaining ecosystems, energy efficiency and future-orientated rural life.

                            <br>
                            The remedies used in the health spas of Lower Saxony are 100 % natural: they originated thousands of years ago, and their beneficial effects can still be felt today.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            And everything really is natural and sustainable – there are no chemical additives or side effects. Brine, for example, contains valuable minerals that you can breathe in as you walk along the wall-like frame known as a graduation tower. Enjoy a peat mud pack at pleasant temperatures — it will relax your body and increase the blood supply right down to your deepest muscles.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            The air is clean and pure in the Harz mountains. The healthy climate is particularly good for your blood circulation and also strengthens your immune system.</p>

You’ll certainly be well looked after at the spas and health resorts of Lower Saxony.
